              After the Civil War and the end of slavery, the southern part of
              the United States faced a big challenge of how to keep farming
              without slaves. The sharecropping system was one solution, where
              farmers who did not own land, usually former slaves or poor white
              laborers, would work on someone else's land in exchange for a
              share of the crops. While it may have seemed like a fair deal at
              first, it often led to a lot of problems for the sharecroppers.
              This demonstrated that the road to economic independence after
              slavery was not easy.

              <h3 class="sect-title">How It Worked</h3>

              <p class="sect-col-description">
                In the sharecropping system, landowners would provide the land,
                seeds, and tools needed, while the sharecroppers did the labor.
                At harvest time, the sharecroppers would give a pretty
                significant part of the crops that they grew to the landowner.
                This would be considered payment for the utilization of the land
                and equipment. While this system was meant to be a partnership,
                it mostly favored the landowners, leaving sharecroppers with
                barely enough to survive. Sharecroppers often had to buy
                supplies from the landowners at high prices and could fall into
                debt. If they could not pay off their debt with their share of
                the crops, they had to keep working to pay it off. This made it
                extremely difficult to leave the reoccurring cycle of poverty.
                Furthermore, this allowed landowners to easily gain advantage
                over sharecroppers, who had little legal protection or rights.

              <h3 class="sect-title">Why It Mattered</h3>

              <p class="sect-col-description">
                Even though they were no longer slaves, the sharecropping system
                had many African Americans, and a small group of poor white
                people sticking to the land. It was a system that continued to
                reinforce racial and economic inequalities in the South. Over
                time, this contributed to a sense of hopelessness and fueled the
                Great Migration. The Great Migration had many people leaving the
                South to find better opportunities in the North and West. Though
                sharecropping was meant to be a way for former slaves to make a
                living, it really became a form of economic control and a way to
                exploit the poor. This sytem lasted for decades, showing that
                the end of slavery was the beginning of a long fight for real
                freedom and equality.

                The 13th Amendment was passed in 1865 and made slavery illegal
                in the United States. It marked the official end of centuries of
                people being bought and sold and forced to work against their
                will. This amendment was viewed as a huge milestone, as it
                legally abolished slavery throughout the country. This allowed
                former slaves to begin their journey toward freedom and
                equality.

              <p class="sect-col-description">
                The 14th Amendment, passed in 1868, declared that anyone born or
                naturalized in the United States is a citizen. This included
                formerly enslaved people, which granted them citizenship meaning
                the same rights as everyone else. It also promised that no one
                would be denied life, liberty, or property without due process
                of law. This enforced the saying that everyone was entitled to
                equal protection under the law. This amendment became the legal
                foundation for many civil rights battles.

                The 15th Amendment was passed in 1870 and dealt with voting
                rights. It stated that no one could be denied the right to vote
                because of their race. This was a significant step as it allowed
                African American men to vote, although it did not include women.
                Unfortunately, despite this amendment, many tactics were used to
                keep black people from voting. A couple of these tactics
                included literacy tests and poll taxes.

              <p class="sect-col-description">
                Together, these Civil Rights Amendments were meant to make
                America more equal, especially dedicated towards former slaves.
                While they were essential for the advancement of civil rights,
                it marked only the beginning of a longer journey ahead. The
                south did not like these changes and resisted them by pushing
                efforts such as creating black codes to restrict the rights of
                African Americans. This led to more struggles and a longer fight
                for equality. While these amendments were crucial, it took
                decades of activism and additional laws to fully push the agenda
                at hand. These amendments still matter today as they remind us
                of the challenges America has faced and the progress that has
                been made since. Furthermore, they also show that the journey
                toward true equality is ongoing.

              Sharecropping was a farming system that was brought about in the
              southern part of the United States after the Civil War, during the
              Reconstruction Era. It was a way for landowners, who were often
              former plantation owners, to allow their land to produce crops
              without hiring workers. Even more, it allowed for tenant farmers,
              former slaves, to earn a living without being formally employed.
              In this system of sharecropping, the landowners provided the land,
              seeds, and tools, while the sharecroppers did the labor work of
              planting, growing, and harvesting the crops. In return, the
              sharecroppers gave a large portion of their crops to the
              landowners as payment.

              <h3 class="sect-title">The Reality of Sharecropping</h3>

              <p class="sect-col-description">
                At first, sharecropping seemed like a fair arrangement as it
                offered the opportunity for freed slaves and poor whites to make
                a living. It even allowed landowners to keep their farms
                running. But in reality, it trapped sharecroppers in a cycle of
                debt and poverty. Since the sharecroppers did not own the land,
                they had little control over their work. They relied on the
                landowners for seeds, tools, and other supplies, which would be
                fairly expensive. Landowners could set high prices for these
                supplies and could charge high interest rates for credit, which
                meant sharecroppers often owed more than they earned. Most
                contracts between landowners and sharecroppers were unfairly
                biased toward the landowners, letting them hold a lot of power.
                If sharecroppers did not meet the landowner's expectations or if
                they fell behind on their debts, they could be kicked off the
                land. This made it hard for sharecroppers to drastically change
                their lives or escape poverty.

              <h3 class="sect-title">The Impact of Sharecropping</h3>

              <p class="sect-col-description">
                Sharecropping became one of the symbols of the struggles that
                followed the Civil War. It kept many African Americans and poor
                whites in a state of economic dependency, with little chance to
                move up in the world. Additionally, it contributed to racial
                segregation in the south, with sharecropping farms often being
                separate and unequal. This system lasted till the 20th century,
                reinforcing racial and economic inequalities. Because
                sharecroppers had so little opportunities to improve their
                living situation, many decided to leave the South during the
                Great Migration. They fled to the North and West in search of
                better jobs and a chance for a better life. Sharecropping
                remains as a constant reminder that even though slavery had
                ended, true freedom and equality were still a long way off. It
                demonstrates that the fight for economic justice and civil
                rights was a journey that took time and persistence.

              The Reconstruction Acts were a series of laws that was passed by
              the U.S. Congress between 1867 and 1868. These acts defined the
              process for reintegrating southern states into the Union after the
              Civil War. They aimed to bring the Southern states back while also
              ensuring that the rights of newly freed slaves were protected. The
              Reconstruction Acts took a more serious approach compared to
              previous policies. It utilized the emphasize of military oversight

                Key Aspects: Military Oversight and New State Constitutions
              </h3>

              <p class="sect-col-description">
                The First Reconstruction Act was passed in March of 1867, and
                aimed to divide the former confederate states into five
                different military districts. Each of these districts were to be
                overseen by a union general. This military presence was
                established in order to maintain order and ensure that southern
                states complied with the new policies following the
                reconstruction. The act required southern states to write new
                constitutions that gave African American men the right to vote.
                It even had them uphold the principles of the 14th Amendment,
                which granted citizenship to all people born in the United
                States, including former slaves. The following Reconstruction
                Acts added more conditions for southern states to qualify to
                allow them to rejoin the Union. They had to ratify the 14th
                Amendment and extend voting rights to black men. This aimed to
                prevent states from enacting Black Codes, which were laws that
                restricted the freedoms of African Americans. These acts showed
                that congress was taking a tougher stance on reconstruction,
                while also trying to rebuild the south in a way that promoted
                civil rights and equal treatment under the law.

              <p class="sect-col-description">
                The new rules set by the Reconstruction Acts faced significant
                resistance in the south. Many white southerners did not like the
                idea of military rule or giving African Americans the right to
                vote. Some resorted to violence, which led to the rise of groups
                such as the Ku Klux Klan, who utilized fear tactics to maintain
                control. This resistance made it challenging for the
                Reconstruction Acts to have their intended impact. Despite the
                initial goals of the Reconstruction Acts, the resistance they
                faced contributed to the decline of the Reconstruction era by
                the mid 1870s. These acts played a crucial role in shaping the
                course of reconstruction, but their effectiveness depended on
                actually enforcing them. While they had some success in
                promoting civil rights, the struggle for racial equality in the
                United States continued.

              Jim Crow laws were state and local laws in the Southern United
              States that enforced racial segregation and discrimination from
              the late 1800s to the mid 1900s. These laws were named after a
              character from racist minstrel shows. They established a separate
              but equal system, but when put in place, led to significant
              discrimination and inequality for African Americans. Jim Crow laws
              affected pretty much every place of life in the South, reinforcing
              a system of racial hierarchy.

              <p class="sect-col-description">
                Jim Crow laws meant that African Americans and white Americans
                had to use separate public facilities. This included schools,
                buses, trains, theaters, restaurants, and even water fountains.
                Although the laws claimed to be separate but equal, the
                facilities for black people were always worse. They were either
                underfunded, in poor condition, or neglected altogether. In
                addition to public segregation, these laws also made it much
                harder for African Americans to vote. This was done through the
                utilization of a series of tests which included literacy tests,
                poll taxes, and other barriers designed to keep them out of
                voting. These laws created an environment where racism was not
                only accepted but legally enforced. Black people faced
                discrimination in housing and employment, and they had limited
                legal rights.

                Fighting Jim Crow and the Legacy It Left Behind
              </h3>

              <p class="sect-col-description">
                Despite the harsh realities of Jim Crow, resistance to these
                laws grew during the 20th century. Many of these efforts led to
                significant civil rights achievements. The supreme court
                decision in Brown vs Board of Education in 1954 declared that
                segregated schools were unconstitutional. This began the
                upcoming of Civil Rights Movement. This movement led to the
                Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned racial discrimination,
                and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which protected voting rights
                for African Americans. Although these legal victories undermined
                the Jim Crow system, the legacy and history that these laws left
                behind still effect American society. The decades of segregation
                and discrimination developed inequalities that continue to
                impact education, employment, and the criminal justice system.
